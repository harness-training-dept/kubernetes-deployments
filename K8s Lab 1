# Basic Kubernetes Deployments Using Harness #

### Lab 1 - Familiarizing yourself with the training environment.


Each student has a dedicated single-server Kubernetes cluster based on upstream K8s and Centos. You will run your deployments on this server throughout the rest of the training. 

Steps:

1: SSH in to your training server. Your instructor will have given you the IP address and the password on the lab sheet handed out at the start of class. 

````ssh centos@<training server IP>````
